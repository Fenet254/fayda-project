## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement 
Many citizens experience long, unpredictable waiting times at government offices such as hospitals, police stations, tax offices, and kebeles. These delays waste valuable time, cause frustration, and sometimes prevent people from receiving essential services altogether. Current queue systems are often manual, lack transparency, and do not provide real-time updates, leading to overcrowding, unfairness, and inefficiency. This problem affects a wide range of people daily and reduces the overall effectiveness of public service delivery.

### Planned Solution  
Our project is a Fayda ID-Based Digital Queue & Token System that enables citizens to:  
- Log in securely using their Fayda ID  
- Select the government office they need to visit  
- Book a queue number or schedule an appointment slot  
- Receive notifications and reminders about their turn  
- View real-time queue status updates
This system will streamline waiting lines, reduce overcrowding, and make public services more accessible and transparent.

### Expected Outcome 

- Significant reduction in waiting times and frustration for citizens  
- Increased transparency and efficiency in government office operations  
- A scalable platform that can be extended to multiple offices and services  
- Demonstrate practical, user-friendly application of Fayda for national digital

### Fayda's Role  

Fayda is the key to securely identifying and authenticating users in our system. By using Fayda ID for login, we ensure that every citizen is uniquely verified, which helps prevent misuse and queue abuse. This makes the booking process safe, fair, and personalized. Fayda also simplifies authentication by removing the need for separate passwords, improving user experience. Additionally, Faydaâ€™s secure APIs help protect user data and enable easy integration with other government services, supporting wider digital transformation efforts.
